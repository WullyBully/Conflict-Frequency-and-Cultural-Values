# Final Econometrics project

### Conflict Frequnecy and Cultural Values

This was my final project for my graduate econometrics course. Notice that the datasets are not inlcuded, as they were too large of files.

The statistical modeling was done almost entirely in stata, as that was what the course prefered, but some of the data preprocessing was done in python.

## Data Sets
Here are the links to the data sets that were used in the project.
